              <b>Matthew Heard</b>: software developer behind Dendrite. He began
                  working on Dendrite in 2013. Matthew's primary motivation for
                  Dendrite is to build a creative environment which gets better
                  when more people create stories, as he wants to explore how
                  network effects and organic user contributions can combine to
                  bloom new communities.
            </div>
            <div>
              Matthew has optimised Dendrite to run well on multiple platforms
                  and browsers, as he considers that accessibility is pivotal to
                  obtaining collaboration from a wide variety of users.
